## About Me
I am a passionate software engineering graduate from Curtin University, with an interest in Java/Kotlin, Android development and user interface design.

Recently I have been working on a variety of software engineering projects to learn and gain experience with the latest software development frameworks, constantly improving my skills in programming and project management.
