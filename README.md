## About Me
I am a passionate software engineer graduate of Curtin University, having studied from 2019-2022.

I have been working on a variety of software engineering projects to learn and gain experience with the latest software development frameworks, and constantly improve my programming and project management skills.

Recently I have taken up an interest in Java and Android development and user interface design.
